This project required me to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) application that simulates stock market trading using Java. My responsibilities included designing and implementing the application's functionality, including the user interface and data visualization. I had to simulate various trading scenarios to test the application's functionality and performance. This project provided me with experience in developing financial simulation applications and allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics of stock market trading.
